# CyclingPortal
System backend in Java to manage cycling races and points

This project was completed as part of a University Module with @Jessie-McColm

# Specification

Documentation and specifications, as outlined in files `BadCyclingPortal.java`, `BadMiniCyclingPortal.java` and `CyclingPortalInterface`, were provided.

We implemented the functionality in these specifications to fit the needs for an unspecified frontend system.

This was a great exercise in developing and testing a Backend to specific requirements when the Fontend was unknown.

The code was tested rigorously using code written in the IDE BlueJ which has been ommited from the repository.
